# **MosquiEye â€“ Smart Mosquito Monitoring**

**MosquiEye** is an AI-powered web and mobile application designed to automate the process of mosquito egg counting and visualize mosquito breeding hotspots using ovitrap data. The system provides Ministry of Health officers with real-time insights and analytics to enhance mosquito control efforts.

## **Project Overview**

MosquiEye leverages AI technology to detect and count mosquito eggs from images uploaded by field officers. It also integrates GPS data to display mosquito breeding hotspots on an interactive map, allowing for more efficient mosquito monitoring and control.

## **Features**
- **AI-Powered Mosquito Egg Counting**: Automatically detect and count mosquito eggs from ovitrap images using machine learning algorithms.
- **Hotspot Visualization**: Interactive maps to visualize mosquito breeding hotspots and trends based on ovitrap locations.
- **Real-Time Data Analysis**: Live data updates and trend analysis on mosquito populations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Seamless experience across web and mobile platforms (PWA) for public health officers.
- **Report Generation**: Export detailed reports in various formats (PDF, CSV) for analysis and decision-making.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Ionic for mobile and PWA support
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API development
- **AI/ML**: Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch for the AI model
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage
- **GIS**: Leaflet.js for interactive map and hotspot visualization
- **DevOps**: Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud services (AWS/GCP)

## **Project Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- Python 3.x (for AI model development)
